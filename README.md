I worked on a computer graphics project where I designed a village scenario using OpenGL in C++. I implemented animations and transitions such as sunrise, cloud movement, parachute movement, and cars running on the road. This project improved my skills in coding, visualization, and understanding graphical principles. It also provided hands-on experience in different domains of computer science and helped me develop the ability to share knowledge effectively.
